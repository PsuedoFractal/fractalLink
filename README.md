Don't use this lol

Rewriting stuff cuz I know some more scarpet now. Will also contain newer better features.

## Plans: (The order may or maynot be followed, except 1 whcih will be done first)

### 1. Rewrite stuff to be easier to read
Gonna take the least amount of time. Should make readbility x100 times better. Edit: Did I say least amount of time?? That would have been the case if I was motivated. I am really not motivated rn.

### 2. Inventory will be viewed as a picture
Using scarpet grpahics, plan is to make everything look very good

### 3. Search for an item, in a particular location
Idea stolen from Crec's suggestion to Kikugie in mecha #coding channel

### 4. Scoreboard query support
Self explnatory, I finally have a few ideas to breach this. I am coming for u again litebot

### 5. Making ux / ui more customizable
Vague terms I know
