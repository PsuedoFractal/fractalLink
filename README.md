# Fractal Link
Use main branch for time being.

Rewriting stuff cuz I know more scarpet now. This will also contain newer and better features.

## Plans: (The order may or maynot be followed, except the rewrite which will be done first)

### 1. Rewrite stuff to be easier to read
This will make readability atleast a 100x better and is going to take a lot of time to get done with.

### 2. Inventory will be viewed as a picture
Using scarpet grpahics, I plan on making everything look very good and compact.

### 3. Search for an item, in a particular location
Idea stolen from Crec's suggestion to Kikugie in mecha #coding channel.

### 4. Scoreboard query support
I finally have a few ideas on how to approach this. This should also include Leo's stat script support.

### 5. Making ux / ui more customizable and better
Vague terms I know, I dont know much about what I am supposed to do. Suggestions in Issues.
